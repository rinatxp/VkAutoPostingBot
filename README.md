## VkAutoPostingBot
This bot periodically checks posts from VK groups that you chosed, then takes more popular, sends them to your private telegram chanel using queue. You can like or dislike each suggested post (like in Tinder). If you like one, bot automatically posts it in your VK group (with delay and with link to the original source), and will suggest you next post.

### Example:
1) Some post from one of the chosen VK groups:

2) The bot sends this post to you in Telegram:

3) If you liked the post, bot will post it in your VK group:
